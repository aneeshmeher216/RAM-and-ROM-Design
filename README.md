* Non-Volatile
* Almost every computer comes with a small amount of ROM containing boot firmware of the system

**RAM**
* RAM is volatile and all its data is lost once the power on it is lost,
* Made up of small memory chips that form the memory module
* Whenever a program is opened its content is copied into RAM so that processor can access it faster
